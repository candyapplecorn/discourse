I waited a while before getting one. I couldn't make my mind up; was I actually going to ride it? Riding a unicycle seemed crazy at the time, and all my friends and family though so too. They didn't think it was crazy as in "crazy cool", they thought it was just silly and a clown-only activity.

Turns out they were wrong.

That there's my first unicycle. Well, it's not literally mine; that one's red, mine's black with turquoise decals. I should also mention that mine's perpetually covered in a golden-brown layer of dirt.

That dirt's not from the street. It's from my local hiking trails. "Muni", short for mountain unicycling, is where a unicyclist unicycles... in mountains. I do that. Just did it yesterday actually, and even took some video:

Between the 20+ miles I ride every week, the hiking trails and hills I grind through, and the fitness I've gained, nobody I know thinks it's a joke anymore.
